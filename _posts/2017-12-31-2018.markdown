Exactly one year ago, the anxious anticipation of 2017 felt comparable to the precipitous climb up a croaking, battered rollercoaster ride's first slope. The president's inauguration was an obvious inflection point that signaled no return to normalcy. As bizarre as our new-world politics came to be—both domestic and overseas—the world watched with jeering eyes (as if we aren't totally ashamed) as history repeats itself, again. Even so, the more privileged lifestyles led in the urban sprawls of Southern California felt largely unchanged, except for the continued rising cost of living and the ever-increasing rates of traffic congestion.

Dysfunctional countries are still committing atrocities, and political provocations between "functional" states are reopening wounds that we thought were stitched since World War II ended, and sewn and stapled when Cold War dissipated. Nationalism has been dangerously winning democratic elections across the globe all year. Populism is devaluing the need for a globally connected future that we should be building today. Our environment continues to descend towards a whimpering death, with minimal efforts shown by our political leaders towards slowing it down.

But life in Los Angeles is still the same: in our free time we watch new TV shows, we contemplate upgrading to the newest iPhone models, and we toss paper cups from Starbucks on our morning commutes to class and work. Of course, we feel disenfranchised, but we really don't have the spare time to find out where the polling booths are located.

Since the Women's March, I still had hoped that a radical change would somehow occur somewhere in the middle of 2017. Every day was a breaking news day. The mechanics of how Russia upended America's democratic process eventually revealed itself. Affordable healthcare has not yet been repealed despite numerous efforts. The attitude towards sexual assault has finally shifted from secrecy to open condemnation.

These developments are all good, but Trump is still president, Woody Allen is still revered, nuclear weapons are still being caressed by semi-literate idiots, and guns are still way too easy to obtain in America.

On our own campus, USC continues to gentrify the South Central neighborhood in a manner that is clearly visible from the window seats of flights arriving LAX. Our newly erected collegiate gothic buildings continue to anesthetize our All-American college experience. Because as students, what can we do? It's not our job to be the fixers, and besides, our attention is absorbed by competition in highly saturated career fields. We wait or hope for world issues to blow over. Our generation is of complacent observers with thumbs stuck to devices.

Perhaps I should have written a more positive, uplifting essay, and encouraged everyone to continue to strive towards their personal goals in 2018. But as students, we also need to reorient how we think about our participation in this destabilizing political climate. We won't affect immediate change in 2018, but we aren't totally powerless either. I wish you all a successful and productive year, but I  hope you all have a thoughtful and purposeful year too.
